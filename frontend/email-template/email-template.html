        <h2>Hey,</h2>
        <p>Thanks for checking in. This is my first container app that i build as part of my cloud learning path.</p>
		
        <h2>Setup Explanation</h2>
		
        <h3>1. Static Web Page on Azure</h3>
        <p>The front-end of this application is a static webpage hosted on <strong>Azure Storage</strong>. 
		The webpage contains a contact form where users can enter their email. This form sends a POST request to a backend API when submitted.</p>
       
	    <h3>2. Backend - Node.js in Docker</h3>
        <p>The backend API that handles the form submission is built with <strong>Node.js</strong> and runs inside a <strong>Docker container</strong>. 
		The container is responsible for receiving the POST request from the static webpage and sending an email.</p>
       
	    <h3>3. Email Sending with SendGrid</h3>
        <p>To send the emails, the application integrates with <strong>SendGrid</strong> as the email service provider. 
		SendGrid provides an API that the application uses to send emails. The API key is securely stored in the environment variable, 
		which is loaded into the app using a <code>.env</code> file.</p>
       
	    <h3>4. Docker Container Setup</h3>
        <p>The backend API is packaged into a Docker image. The container is exposed on port 3000, which is configured to handle the requests from the static webpage.</p>
      
	    <h3>5. CI/CD Pipeline for Deployment</h3>
        <p>The application is deployed using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) pipeline, 
		which automatically updates the application whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository. </p>
       
	    <h3>6. Local Development and Testing</h3>
        <p>During the development process, the static webpage and backend API are tested locally. The Docker container is run on a virtual machine, 
		and the static webpage is hosted using Visual Studio Code's Live Server.</p>
